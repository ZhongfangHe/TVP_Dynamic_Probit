# TVP_Dynamic_Probit

This folder contains the Matlab codes and data spreadsheets for replications of my paper "A dynamic binary probit model with time-varying parameters and shrinkage prior".

The main code is "main_simulated_data.m" for the simulation study and "main_predict_recession.m" for the empirical study. The simulated data are in the spreadsheets "Simulated_Data_DProb_IB.xlsx" and "Simulated_Data_DProbTVP_IB.xlsx". The empirical data is in the spreadsheet "Data_Recession.xlsx". The other Matlab files are functions and should not be modified.
