# TVP_Dynamic_Probit

This folder contains the Matlab codes and data spreadsheets for replications of my paper "*A dynamic binary probit model with time-varying parameters and shrinkage prior*".

The main code is "*main_est_sim2.m*" for the simulation study and "*main_predict_recession.m*" for the empirical study. The simulated data are in the spreadsheet "*SimData_DPTVP.xlsx*". The empirical data is in the spreadsheet "*Data_Recession.xlsx*". The other Matlab files are functions and should not be modified.
